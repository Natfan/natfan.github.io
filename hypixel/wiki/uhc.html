			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>Hypixel's <b>UHC Champions</b> is a hardcore survivalist gamemode based around player vs player
				combat. The game is largly a vanilla gamemode but has the following changes to it.
				<ul>
					<li>Time is locked at 14:00, or midday. There is no night.</li>
					<li>Ocean biomes and long River biomes are disabled and will not generate.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Interestingly, these biomes will still "spawn", as can be seen in the F3 menu. They will not
							generate the same way as in vanilla however. This leads to the following changes:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>River biomes have no water in them, leaving just the river beds.</li>
								<li>Ocean biomes will generate to have the same terrain structure as Plains biomes.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Chickens will always drop at least one Feather.</li>
					<li>Spiders will always drop at least one String.</li>
					<li>Sheep will always drop at least one Raw Porkchop.</li>
					<li>Blazes will always drop at least one Blaze Rod.</li>
					<li>Ghasts drop one Nether Wart and five Arrows, but no Ghast Tears.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This effectively prevents the brewing of Regeration Potions naturally, although they can still
							be crafted using custom crafting recipes.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Silverfish always drop at least one slimeball.</li>
					<li>Skeletons have a 15% chance to drop a full durability bow, along with the vanilla 8.5% chance
						of dropping a bow with random durability.</li>
					<li>Wither Skeletons do not influct the Wither effect on hit.</li>
					<li>Gravel has a 25% chance to drop flint.</li>
					<li>All mobs give double the experience.</li>
					<li>Player kills give an extra 50 EXP.</li>
					<li>Blazes randomly spawn in the Nether, you won’t need to find a fortress to find Blazes.</li>
					<li>All players spawn with 40 HP.</li>
					<li>On death players drop their head, right clicking this head will give 4 seconds of Regeneration
						II to you and all your teammates.</li>
					<li>Golden Apples regen 4 Hearts instead of 2.</li>
					<li>Glistening melons require ingots instead of nuggets in their craft.</li>
					<li>Ore generation is increased.</li>
					<li>Strength Potions have been nerfed by 62%.</li>
					<li>Hunger has been nerfed a bit, you won’t lose hunger as fast as in vanilla.</li>
					<li>Each player spawns with a compass pointing at your teammates, very useful.</li>
					<li>Players get 15 seconds of fire resistance upon entering the Nether.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The game has two seperate modes, Teams and Solo. While generally similar, they have a few
				key differences between them.
