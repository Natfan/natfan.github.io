<p>So about a week or two ago I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_(2017_film)">Dunkirk (2017)</a> with my mother. Well, when I say <i>watched with my mother</i> I mean that we bought tickets that were on different rows, as it was packed. And rightly so, it was one of the best war films I have ever seen, not that that list is very long though. Actually, thinking about it, I could count all the war films I've seen on one hand.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Colditz</li>
    <li>Fury. I'll talk about this later in another rant because I have a few words to say about my experiences when watching that film.</li>
    <li>Dunkirk (2017)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, that's beside the point. I really liked this movie. It was a tense, taught thriller all the way through that was generally realistic (bar a few exceptions which I may talk about in another post) with good acting, good location, well shot and more. It was everything I'd come to expect after watching some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s other work. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)">The Dark Knight</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises">The Dark Knight Rises</a> both had a similar feel to Dunkirk, in that they were high action and very well made thrillers. They also both had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a> at the helm, as the lead music composer of the films. And that is what I want to go into with this blog post, about the effect that a well constructed musical score can do to a film.</p>

<p>Hans Zimmer has created the score for some of the greatest epics of the last decade including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_(2000_film)">Gladiator</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Samurai">The Last Samurai</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thin_Red_Line_(1998_film)">The Thin Red Line</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)">Interstellar</a>. He has also worked with some less serious films such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King">The Lion King</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda_(soundtrack)">King Fu Panda</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_Man">Rain Man</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_Miss_Daisy">Driving Miss Daisy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_English">Johnny English</a>. I think just his impressive list of musical scores to his name, which I did admitted lift from his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Zimmer_discography">Wikipedia page</a>, shows what an incredible person he is.</p>
