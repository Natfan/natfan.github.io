<p>So about a week or two ago I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_(2017_film)">Dunkirk (2017)</a> with my mother. Well, when I say <i>watched with my mother</i> I mean that we bought tickets that were on different rows, as it was packed. And rightly so, it was one of the best war films I have ever seen, not that that list is very long though. Actually, thinking about it, I could count all the war films I've seen on one hand.
 
<ul>
    <li>Colditz</li>
    <li>Fury. I'll talk about this later in another rant because I have a few words to say about my experiences when watching that film.</li>
    <li>Dunkirk (2017)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, that's beside the point. I really liked this movie. It was a tense, taught thriller all the way through that was generally realistic (bar a few exceptions which I may talk about in another post) with good acting, good location, well shot and more. It was everything I'd come to expect after watching some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s other work. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)">The Dark Knight</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises">The Dark Knight Rises</a> both had a similar feel to Dunkirk, in that they were high action and very well made thrillers. They also both had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a> at the helm, as the lead music composer of the films. And that is what I want to go into with this blog post, about the effect that a well constructed musical score can do to a film.

<p>Hans Zimmer has created the score for some of the greatest epics of the last decade including Gladiator, The Last Samurai, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk. He has also worked with some less serious films such as The Lion
