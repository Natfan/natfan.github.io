			<h5>An Open Letter to Reconal</h5>
			<p>Hey guys, this is an open letter to make a bit of transparency between the team,</p>
			<p>So @reconal has been super inactive recently. Within the leadership team we've all been given different jobs to do, and @reconal's was to get a referral system set up so that we can get more players. Another role that he had was to contact a YouTuber and @petwoh would shell out some money towards it.</p>
			<p>On the first issue, @reconal said that it was "impossible" and didn't even start to try. So much for impossible, as I got it ~60% working without his help, and I'm not a sysadmin. I'm just a geek who uses Arch Linux as his daily driver at college, and I could get the "impossible" to start to work in under an hour.</p>
			<p>On the second issue, @reconal went dark about 2 days ago. Aside from the odd post on the forums, no one has heard from him at all. Total communications blackout. He ducked out of his responsibilities and, because of this, we may have a very low player count on release.</p>
			<p>Another issue that @reconal has is that he constantly wants to change things up in the network. From our forum software (from Nameless [free] to Xenforo [paid]) to our CDN (content distribution network) (from Cloud, which @brendanleet paid for out of his own pocket (30 EUR) to some other software that we never used). I'm a big fan of the old adage "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" but apparently @reconal doesn't agree. To add on to this, @reconal always requests that @brendanleet creates stupid, pointless stuff that either does not need to be custom (there are many other alternatives that would be better) or are simply just not needed. Another thing that he wants is to make everything custom, all hooked up into a core plugin, but many things that we already have on the network is perfect as is.</p>
			<p>@reconal also has a tendancy to change things without asking. Whenever myself or @brendanleet make a change, we ask about it in #owners, then discuss it before implementing. Even if we don't ask, we still inform the others about the changes that we're making so that we can be all on the same page if something breaks, so that we know what the probable causes are. There are two examples that come to mind here. Recently @reconal added the build server onto Bungee because "builders asked him to" but we have no proof of that ever happening. The reason as to why the build server is seperate from the network is a matter of both security and convenience. If a builder's account was hacked, the hacker could not access the server by issuing /server build, they would have to know the port along with the IP address, adding a layer of security. Another reason is that if the bungee network needs to go into maintainance, all servers on the bungee network will be no longer accessable. this is why build servers are seperate from development servers, as one cannot interupt the other's workflow. @reconal just decided to bypass all of this careful thought and planning and just popped it on the network without telling us. Another thing that he changed, back in the old days of Eyslium, was that he changed the server from being 1.7/1.8 to a pure 1.8 server, breaking code and decimating our potential playerbase without even having told us about it.</p>
			<p>Both PetWoh, BrendanLeeT and myself have confirmed that we will step down from our positions after the release if @reconal doesn't get his act together and own up to his mistakes. If the three of us leave, we will take everything with us and there will be next to nothing left. If we leave, we will take the time to revamp Hurricane 2.0 and release with even more features. All staff members and donators may keep their ranks if they wish to, we're not going to kick anyone out.</p>
			<p>I'm reminded of this conversation from the British sitcom The Thick Of It: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0CXu2yz7xo</p>
			<p>Here's another one, to remind you why you should always own up to your mistakes as quickly as possible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmkwavPi0xo</p>
			<p>Shit is getting real very, very quickly and it's time for @reconal to step up and do his job.</p>
