Just to preface this story, I work at a University which has lots of leisure activity areas on campus such as gyms, bars etc.

So my colleague got a ticket today that completely cracked me up. The following is a rough translation of the conversation between my colleague and myself.

**N**: Me, Natfan!
**R**: My colleague, who's name starts with an R.

> **R**: **N**, you know lots about computers, right?
>
> **N**: Yeah, what's up?
>
> **R**: What do you know about pool tables?
>
> **N**: I'm sorry, what?
