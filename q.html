<p>So I just finished watching Master of None Season 2 on Netflix and I must say, it was bloody brilliant. I've binge-watched it over the last weekend, all ten 35 minute episodes and it was a magically journey. I didn't think that the show could pull my heartstrings anymore than the first season did, but boy, was I wrong!</p>

<p>This second season had a very different feel to it. It felt much slower and that there was more of an overarching plot than that of the first, where Rachel, Dev's love focus, is only properly introduced in Episode 6. Before that she was more of a side character than anything else, a remote possibility of a relationship that Dev might get later down the line. In Season 2, we are introduced to Francesca, a beautiful Italian woman who speaks rather broken English who is in a super long-term relationship with a guy called Pino, a tile distributor. Dev is working in Italy as an apprentice Pasta Maker, which is a direct continuation from the (sort of) cliffhanger that we were left on at the end of last season.</p>
