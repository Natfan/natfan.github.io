			<h5>Life</h5>
			<p>
				Hey guys,

				After reading a long and heartfelt post from a close friend of mine, which had a lot of personal subjects and open thoughts, I decided to document my life on this website. The file structure of <code>/life/x/y</code>, where x is my age as an integer and y is a story from that year. Obviously <code>/life/1</code> is stories from when I was 1 year old, and <code>/life/99</code> is stories from when I was 99 years old. That last one hasn't happened yet, PSA.

				Consider this like the microblogging service Twitter, but it's not micro and it may not even be a blog. Oh, and it ISN'T called Twitter.

			        Yours,
			        - Natfan.
